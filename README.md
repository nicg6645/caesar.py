# caesar.py
Designed to provide practice for students participating in the Codebusters event at Science Olympiad, this function performs a caesar shift of given key on one of the 1000 most common words in the english language, chosen at random. However, the way in which python's native ord() and chr() functions are called means that it's quite buggy for larger keys.
